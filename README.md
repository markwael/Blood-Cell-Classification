# Blood-Cell-Classification
# 🩸 Blood Cell Classification & Image Preprocessing Web App  

🚀 **A Deep Learning-based Web App for Blood Cell Classification and Image Preprocessing using Streamlit.**  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify blood cells into four categories:  
🔹 EOSINOPHIL  
🔹 LYMPHOCYTE  
🔹 MONOCYTE  
🔹 NEUTROPHIL  

Additionally, it includes an **Image Preprocessing** module that allows users to apply transformations like rotation, zooming, translation, and flipping in real-time.

## 🔬 Dataset  
The dataset used for training is available on Kaggle:  
📌 [Blood Cell Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/blood-cells)  

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Blood Cell Classification** using pre-trained deep learning models:  
   - ResNet50  
   - EfficientNetB0  
   - VGG16  
   - DenseNet121  
✅ **Image Preprocessing**: Rotation, Translation, Zooming, Flipping, and Normalization  
✅ **Interactive UI**: Simple drag-and-drop image upload  
✅ **Real-time Predictions** with Confidence Scores
